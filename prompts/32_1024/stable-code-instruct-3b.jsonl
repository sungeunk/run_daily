Taking folding a rose as an example, we can, divide the entire process into three stages, including: firstly creating a grid of creases, secondly making a three-dimensional base, and thirdly finishing petal decoration. The first step is to create a grid of creases: this step is a bit like the first step of folding a gift of thousand-paper-crane. That is to say, we can fold the paper in half (or namedly equal-folds) through the symmetrical axis, and repeat such step in the other symmetrical axis. And then apply multiple equal-folds in sequence relative to each smaller rectangle divided by the two creases; After that, the creases in each direction will interweave into a complete set of uniform small square splicing patterns; these small squares form a reference space similar to a two-dimensional coordinate system, allowing us to combine adjacent creases on the plane from Three-dimensional high platforms or depressions are folded on the two-dimensional small squares to facilitate the next steps of folding. It should be noted that, in the process of creating grid creases, there may be rare cases when the folds are not aligned. The consequences of this error can be very serious. And just like the butterfly effect, it is only a slight difference at the beginning, and in the end it may generate a disaster world which is completely different from plan. Anyway, let's continue. The second step is make the three-dimensional base: In this step, we need to fold a set of symmetrical three-dimensional high platforms or depressions based on the grid creases. From the symmetry analysis, it is not difficult to find that the rose will have four symmetrical three-dimensional high platforms and supporting depressions. Therefore, we can firstly fold out a quarter of the depression and plateau patterns, which would help build a base to compose into a complex 3D structure. And then, we use this quarter as a template, and fold out the repeating patterns on the remaining three parts of the whole structure in turn. It is worth noting that the layout of the high platform not only needs to consider the regular contrast and symmetrical distribution of the length and width, but also needs to ensure the orderliness of the height dimension. This is very important, since we will never go back to this step after all parts were made, and you would better start from first step if you make anything wrong in the this step. Similar to the precautions in the first stage, please handle all the corners in three dimensions to ensure that they conform to the layout required in the plan, which would help us avoid the butterfly effect and increase the robustness in the process of three-dimensional folding. Just like building a skyscrapper in the real world, people usually take a lot of time when building the base but soon get finished when extending the structure after that. Time is worth to cost in the base, but would be saved in the future after you succeed in base. Anyway, let's continue. During the first quarter of the pattern, repeated comparisons with the finished rose were made to eliminate any possible errors in the first place. The final stage is to finish the petal grooming. At this stage, we often emphasize an important term called folding-by-heart. The intention here is no longer literally serious, but focus is moved to our understanding of the shape of a rose in nature, and we usually use natural curves to continuously correct the shape of petals in order to approach the shape of rose petals in reality. One more comment: this is also the cause of randomness to the art, which can be generated differently by different people. Recall that rose should be adjusted close to reality, so in the last step of this stage, we need to open the bloom in the center of the rose, by pulling on the four petals that have been bent. This process may be accompanied by the collapse of the overall structure of the rose, so we should be very careful to save strength of adjustment, and it must be well controlled to avoid irreversible consequences. Ultimately, after three stages of folding, we end up with a crown of rose with a similar shape close to reality. If condition is permited, we can wrap a green paper strip twisted on a straightened iron wire, and insert the rose crown we just created onto one side of the iron wire. Different color of rose is usually more attractive and can be considered as a better plan of gift to your friend. In summary, by creating a grid of creases, making a three-dimensional base, and finishing with petals, we created a three-dimensional beautiful rose from a two-dimensional paper. Although this process may seem to be very simple, it is indeed a demanding work of art created by us humans with the help of our creativity and imagination and the common materials that are available.
