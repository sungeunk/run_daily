You have this truly beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through your whole body? Can you feel the great majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you are a part of it? Take a moment to kneel down and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith, life and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his paternal love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it is totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous so chose the option hat brings maximum comfort to you. The priest won't treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been 10 years since my last confession.\" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's all fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing and knows that you ma feel unsure. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit next to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the general idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it is been since your last confession (if you do not voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. Tt is just a casual conversation whichich has the only one purpose - to clean your heart up and strenghten your faith! Do not feel fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you are always more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part can be intimidating at times, but think about it this way: the priest you are talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \"I did so and so,\" will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you do not remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you do not remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you are being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, forgives sins and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this: My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy. If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. I detest all of my sins because of thy just punishment. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, absolutely clean slate to work with. To clarify, \"absolution\" means your sins are washed away. \"Penance\" is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you are truly sorry and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven."}
