{"type": "code_gen","language": "EN","word_num": "1024","prompt": "Write a Python function which follows this instruction: Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N] inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid. You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells, in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current cell. Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not necessarily distinct). You CANNOT go off the grid. A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k) such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have lst_A[j] = lst_B[j]. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique. Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through. Assume the environment has the latest versions of dependencies installed. Optimize the code for better performance and readability without altering its core functionality. The optimized code should adhere to PEP 8 standards for Python code style and demonstrate best practices in error handling and resource management. Optimize Performance: Identify and eliminate any inefficiencies in the code, such as loops that can be vectorized or operations that can be performed more effectively using pandas or numpy functions. Improve Readability: Refactor the code to enhance readability. This includes renaming variables for clarity, adding comments to explain complex operations, and organizing the code into functions or classes as appropriate. Error Handling: Implement error handling to manage potential issues, such as file not found errors or invalid data types. Resource Management: Ensure that all resources, like file handles, are properly managed using context managers or other best practices. Apply best programming practices and PEP rules in order to keep the code Pythonic. Comment and Document: While your code should be self-explanatory, comments and documentation are crucial for explaining complex logic, assumptions, and decisions made during development. Documenting APIs and key functionalities is especially important. Write Modular Code: Break your code into smaller, reusable modules or functions. This not only makes your code more manageable and testable but also promotes code reuse. Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD): Write tests for your functions before you even write the code to implement those functions. This ensures your code meets the required specifications from the start and helps catch bugs early in the development process. Refactor Regularly: Don't be afraid to refactor your code. Refactoring involves restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior to improve its internal structure. This is key to maintaining a clean and efficient codebase. Handle Errors Gracefully: Implement comprehensive error handling to manage unexpected or exceptional situations. This fairly improves the robustness of your application. Keep Security in Mind: Always consider security implications. Follow secure coding practices to protect your application from vulnerabilities. Use Meaningful Commit Messages: When using version control, write descriptive commit messages. This helps others understand the purpose of your changes and makes it easier to track the history of your project. Meaningful Names: Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Short Functions: Aim to keep functions focused. A good rule of thumb is that scrolling should not be necessary to read an entire function. Additionally keep in mind the following rules: Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than right now.[d] If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
